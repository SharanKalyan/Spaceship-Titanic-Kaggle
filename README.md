# Spaceship-Titanic-Kaggle

Data source : https://www.kaggle.com/

I have 3 notebooks, 

1. Data cleansing for creating the "clean test.csv" and "clean train.csv" files
2. Analaysis and Visualizations for creating "to_machinelearning.csv" file 
3. Machine Learning to predict weather a particular passenger would get transported or not.

I tried ensembling all models, but the Standalone XGB model has given the best score so far! 

I was able to achive the Kaggle score of 0.80056

Ranked 237 / 750
